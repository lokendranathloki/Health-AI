# 🚀 HealthAI – Intelligent Healthcare Assistant Using IBM Granite

## 👤 Solo Project by A Lokendranath
This project was developed **individually** as part of an academic internship under SVCET (Cyber Security). It represents a complete cycle from ideation to deployment.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
**HealthAI** is a smart virtual healthcare assistant that allows users to:

- Register/Login securely
- Ask health-related questions via chatbot
- Predict possible diseases based on symptoms
- Generate basic treatment plans
- Visualize health analytics (BMI, Glucose, etc.)
- Store and manage data using MySQL
- Use IBM Granite 13B model integration (planned/future scope)

It is designed to support users in **rural or semi-urban areas** and eventually work in **offline mode** for low-connectivity zones.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Flask Web Interface (simple and lightweight)
- MySQL Database Integration for user data
- IBM Watson & IBM Granite (planned ML model for disease prediction)
- Health visualizations using charts
- Support for future voice input and telemedicine
